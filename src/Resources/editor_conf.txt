filter = Video
help = The GPU renderer filter function to use when upscaling video. There are some more filters, but most are not as useful. For a complete list, pass help as value, e.g.: mpv --scale=help

option = bilinear          Bilinear hardware texture filtering (fastest, very low quality).
option = spline36          Mid quality and speed. This is the default when using gpu-hq.
option = lanczos           Lanczos scaling. Provides mid quality and speed. Generally worse than spline36, but it results in a slightly sharper image which is good for some content types. The number of taps can be controlled with  scale-radius, but is best left unchanged. (This filter is an alias for sinc-windowed sinc)
option = ewa_lanczos       Elliptic weighted average Lanczos scaling. Also known as Jinc. Relatively slow, but very good quality. The radius can be controlled with scale-radius. Increasing the radius makes the filter sharper but adds more ringing. (This filter is an alias for jinc-windowed jinc)
option = ewa_lanczossharp  A slightly sharpened version of ewa_lanczos, preconfigured to use an ideal radius and parameter. If your hardware can run it, this is probably what you should use by default.
option = mitchell          Mitchell-Netravali. The B and C parameters can be set with  scale-param1 and scale-param2. This filter is very good at downscaling (see dscale).
option = oversample        A version of nearest neighbour that (naively) oversamples pixels, so that pixels overlapping edges get linearly interpolated instead of rounded. This essentially removes the small imperfections and judder artifacts caused by nearest-neighbour interpolation, in exchange for adding some blur. This filter is good at temporal interpolation, and also known as "smoothmotion" (see tscale).

help = When using convolution based filters, extend the filter size when downscaling.

name = d3d11va-zero-copy
file = mpv
default = no
filter = Video
help = By default, when using hardware decoding with --gpu-api=d3d11, the video image will be copied (GPU-to-GPU) from the decoder surface to a shader resource. Set this option to avoid that copy by sampling directly from the decoder image. This may increase performance and reduce power usage, but can cause the image to be sampled incorrectly on the bottom and right edges due to padding, and may invoke driver bugs, since Direct3D 11 technically does not allow sampling from a decoder surface (though most drivers support it.)

option = yes

[setting]
name = hdr-compute-peak
file = mpv
default = auto
filter = Video
help = Compute the HDR peak and frame average brightness per-frame instead of relying on tagged metadata. These values are averaged over local regions as well as over several frames to prevent the value from jittering around too much. This option basically gives you dynamic, per-scene tone mapping. Requires compute shaders, which is a fairly recent OpenGL feature, and will probably also perform horribly on some drivers, so enable at your own risk. The special value auto (default) will enable HDR peak computation automatically if compute shaders and SSBOs are supported.

option = auto
option = yes
option = no

[setting]
name = allow-delayed-peak-detect
file = mpv
default = yes
filter = Video
help = When using --hdr-compute-peak, allow delaying the detected peak by a frame when beneficial for performance. In particular, this is required to avoid an unnecessary FBO indirection when no advanced rendering is required otherwise. Has no effect if there already is an indirect pass, such as when advanced scaling is enabled. (Only affects --vo=gpu-next, note that --vo=gpu always delays the peak.)

help = Specify the sub font size. The unit is the size in scaled pixels at a window height of 720. The actual pixel size is scaled with the window height: if the window height is larger or smaller than 720, the actual size of the text increases or decreases as well. Default: 55

[setting]

type = color
filter = Subtitle
help = Specify the color used for unstyled text subtitles.\n\nThe color is specified in the form r/g/b, where each color component is specified as number in the range 0.0 to 1.0. It's also possible to specify the transparency by using r/g/b/a, where the alpha value 0 means fully transparent, and 1.0 means opaque. If the alpha component is not given, the color is 100% opaque.\n\nPassing a single number to the option sets the sub to gray, and the form gray/a lets you specify alpha additionally.\n\nExamples\n\n1.0/0.0/0.0 set sub to opaque red\n1.0/0.0/0.0/0.75 set sub to opaque red with 75% alpha\n0.5/0.75 set sub to 50% gray with 75% alpha\n\nAlternatively, the color can be specified as a RGB hex triplet in the form #RRGGBB, where each 2-digit group expresses a color value in the range 0 (00) to 255 (FF). For example, #FF0000 is red. This is similar to web colors. Alpha is given with #AARRGGBB.\n\nExamples\n\n#FF0000 set sub to opaque red\n#C0808080 set sub to 50% gray with 75% alpha

help = Always save the current playback position on quit. When this file is played again later, the player will seek to the old playback position on start. This does not happen if playback of a file is stopped in any other way than quitting. For example, going to the next file in the playlist will not save the position, and start playback at beginning the next time the file is played.\n\nThis behavior is disabled by default, but is always available when quitting the player with Shift+Q.

In addition, the player will not exit if no tracks are selected, and wait instead (this wait mode is similar to pausing, but the pause option is not set).\n\nThis is useful with lavfi-complex: you can start playback in this mode, and then set select tracks at runtime by setting the filter graph.

If several files are specified on command line, the entire playlist is looped. The force mode is like inf, but does not skip playlist entries which have been marked as failing.
