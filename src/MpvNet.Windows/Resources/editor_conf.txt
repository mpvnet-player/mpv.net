name = deband_threshold
file = libplacebo
directory = Video/libplacebo/Debanding

name = deband_radius
file = libplacebo

help = <0.0..1000.0> The debanding filter's initial radius. The radius increases linearly for each iteration. A higher radius will find more gradients, but a lower radius will smooth more aggressively. Defaults to 16.0.

directory = Video/Screenshot
help = <0-9> Set the PNG compression level. Higher means better compression. This will affect the file size of the written screenshot file and the time it takes to write a screenshot. Too high compression might occupy enough CPU time to interrupt playback. The default is 7.

name = screenshot-png-filter

directory = Video/Screenshot
help = <0-5> Set the filter applied prior to PNG compression. 0 is none, 1 is 'sub', 2 is 'up', 3 is 'average', 4 is 'Paeth', and 5 is 'mixed'. This affects the level of compression that can be achieved. For most images, 'mixed' achieves the best compression ratio, hence it is the default.

help = Select when to use precise seeks that are not limited to keyframes. Such seeks require decoding video from the previous keyframe up to the target position and so can take some time depending on decoding performance. For some video formats, precise seeks are disabled. This option selects the default choice to use for seeks; it is possible to explicitly override that default in the definition of key bindings and in input commands.
option = yes       Use precise seeks whenever possible.
option = no         Never use precise seeks.
option = absolute  Use precise seeks if the seek is to an absolute position in the file, such as a chapter seek, but not for relative seeks like the default behavior of arrow keys.
option = always    Same as yes (for compatibility).

name = track-auto-selection
file = mpv
default = yes
directory = Playback
help = Enable the default track auto-selection. Enabling this will make the player select streams according to aid, alang, and others. If it is disabled, no tracks are selected. In addition, the player will not exit if no tracks are selected, and wait instead (this wait mode is similar to pausing, but the pause option is not set).\n\nThis is useful with lavfi-complex: you can start playback in this mode, and then set select tracks at runtime by setting the filter graph. Note that if lavfi-complex is set before playback is started, the referenced tracks are always selected.
option = yes
option = no

name = loop-playlist
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = <N|inf|force|no> Loops playback N times. A value of 1 plays it one time (default), 2 two times, etc. inf means forever. no is the same as 1 and disables looping. If several files are specified on command line, the entire playlist is looped. The force mode is like inf, but does not skip playlist entries which have been marked as failing. This means the player might waste CPU time trying to loop a file that doesn't exist. But it might be useful for playing webradios under very bad network conditions.

name = auto-load-folder
file = mpvnet
default = yes
directory = Playback
help = For single files automatically load the entire directory into the playlist. (mpv.net option)
option = yes
option = no

name = reset-on-next-file
file = mpv
directory = Program Behavior
help = Normally, mpv will try to keep all settings when playing the next file on the playlist, even if they were changed by the user during playback. This can be changed with this option. It accepts a list of options, and mpv will reset the value of these options on playback start to the initial value.
