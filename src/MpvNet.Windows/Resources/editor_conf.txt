default = no
directory = Video
help = When using convolution based filters, extend the filter size when downscaling. Increases quality, but reduces performance while downscaling.\n\nThis will perform slightly sub-optimally for anamorphic video (but still better than without it) since it will extend the size to match only the milder of the scale factors between the axes.

help = Enable the debanding algorithm. This greatly reduces the amount of visible banding, blocking and other quantization artifacts, at the expense of very slightly blurring some of the finest details. In practice, it's virtually always an improvement - the only reason to disable it would be for performance.
option = yes

name = d3d11va-zero-copy
file = mpv
default = no
directory = Video
help = By default, when using hardware decoding with --gpu-api=d3d11, the video image will be copied (GPU-to-GPU) from the decoder surface to a shader resource. Set this option to avoid that copy by sampling directly from the decoder image. This may increase performance and reduce power usage, but can cause the image to be sampled incorrectly on the bottom and right edges due to padding, and may invoke driver bugs, since Direct3D 11 technically does not allow sampling from a decoder surface (though most drivers support it.)
option = yes
option = no

name = hdr-compute-peak
file = mpv
default = auto
directory = Video
help = Compute the HDR peak and frame average brightness per-frame instead of relying on tagged metadata. These values are averaged over local regions as well as over several frames to prevent the value from jittering around too much. This option basically gives you dynamic, per-scene tone mapping. Requires compute shaders, which is a fairly recent OpenGL feature, and will probably also perform horribly on some drivers, so enable at your own risk. The special value auto (default) will enable HDR peak computation automatically if compute shaders and SSBOs are supported.
option = auto
option = yes
option = no

name = allow-delayed-peak-detect
file = mpv
default = yes
directory = Video
help = When using --hdr-compute-peak, allow delaying the detected peak by a frame when beneficial for performance. In particular, this is required to avoid an unnecessary FBO indirection when no advanced rendering is required otherwise. Has no effect if there already is an indirect pass, such as when advanced scaling is enabled. (Only affects --vo=gpu-next, note that --vo=gpu always delays the peak.)
option = yes

help = Set the duration of the OSD messages in ms. Default: 1000

name = osd-scale-by-window
file = mpv
default = yes
directory = Screen
help = Whether to scale the OSD with the window size. If this is disabled, osd-font-size and other OSD options that use scaled pixels are always in actual pixels. The effect is that changing the window size won't change the OSD font size.

help = If set to no and keep-open is also set to no, the player exits after the last file ends.
option = yes
option = no
option = once

name = loop-file
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = <N|inf|no> Loop a single file N times. inf means forever, no means normal playback.\n\nThe difference to loop-playlist is that this doesn't loop the playlist, just the file itself. If the playlist contains only a single file, the difference between the two option is that this option performs a seek on loop, instead of reloading the file. loop is an alias for this option.

name = save-position-on-quit
file = mpv
default = no
directory = Playback
help = Always save the current playback position on quit. When this file is played again later, the player will seek to the old playback position on start. This does not happen if playback of a file is stopped in any other way than quitting. For example, going to the next file in the playlist will not save the position, and start playback at beginning the next time the file is played.\n\nThis behavior is disabled by default, but is always available when quitting the player with Shift+Q.
option = yes
option = no

name = watch-later-options
file = mpv

name = hr-seek
file = mpv
default = absolute
directory = Playback
help = Select when to use precise seeks that are not limited to keyframes. Such seeks require decoding video from the previous keyframe up to the target position and so can take some time depending on decoding performance. For some video formats, precise seeks are disabled. This option selects the default choice to use for seeks; it is possible to explicitly override that default in the definition of key bindings and in input commands.
option = yes       Use precise seeks whenever possible.
option = no         Never use precise seeks.
option = absolute  Use precise seeks if the seek is to an absolute position in the file, such as a chapter seek, but not for relative seeks like the default behavior of arrow keys.
option = always    Same as yes (for compatibility).

name = track-auto-selection
file = mpv
default = yes
directory = Playback
help = Enable the default track auto-selection. Enabling this will make the player select streams according to aid, alang, and others. If it is disabled, no tracks are selected. In addition, the player will not exit if no tracks are selected, and wait instead (this wait mode is similar to pausing, but the pause option is not set).\n\nThis is useful with lavfi-complex: you can start playback in this mode, and then set select tracks at runtime by setting the filter graph. Note that if lavfi-complex is set before playback is started, the referenced tracks are always selected.
option = yes
option = no

name = loop-playlist
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = <N|inf|force|no> Loops playback N times. A value of 1 plays it one time (default), 2 two times, etc. inf means forever. no is the same as 1 and disables looping. If several files are specified on command line, the entire playlist is looped. The force mode is like inf, but does not skip playlist entries which have been marked as failing. This means the player might waste CPU time trying to loop a file that doesn't exist. But it might be useful for playing webradios under very bad network conditions.

name = auto-load-folder

name = reset-on-next-file
file = mpv
directory = Program Behavior
help = Normally, mpv will try to keep all settings when playing the next file on the playlist, even if they were changed by the user during playback. This can be changed with this option. It accepts a list of options, and mpv will reset the value of these options on playback start to the initial value.

help = Specify the filename template used to save screenshots. The template specifies the filename without file extension, and can contain format specifiers, which will be substituted when taking a screenshot.

name = screenshot-png-compression
file = mpv
directory = Video/Screenshot
help = <0-9> Set the PNG compression level. Higher means better compression. This will affect the file size of the written screenshot file and the time it takes to write a screenshot. Too high compression might occupy enough CPU time to interrupt playback. The default is 7.

name = screenshot-png-filter
file = mpv
directory = Video/Screenshot
help = <0-5> Set the filter applied prior to PNG compression. 0 is none, 1 is 'sub', 2 is 'up', 3 is 'average', 4 is 'Paeth', and 5 is 'mixed'. This affects the level of compression that can be achieved. For most images, 'mixed' achieves the best compression ratio, hence it is the default.

option = spline36          Mid quality and speed. This is the default when using gpu-hq.
option = lanczos           Lanczos scaling. Provides mid quality and speed. Generally worse than spline36, but it results in a slightly sharper image which is good for some content types. The number of taps can be controlled with  scale-radius, but is best left unchanged. (This filter is an alias for sinc-windowed sinc)
option = ewa_lanczos       Elliptic weighted average Lanczos scaling. Also known as Jinc. Relatively slow, but very good quality. The radius can be controlled with scale-radius. Increasing the radius makes the filter sharper but adds more ringing. (This filter is an alias for jinc-windowed jinc)
option = ewa_lanczossharp  A slightly sharpened version of ewa_lanczos, preconfigured to use an ideal radius and parameter. If your hardware can run it, this is probably what you should use by default.

option = oversample        A version of nearest neighbour that (naively) oversamples pixels, so that pixels overlapping edges get linearly interpolated instead of rounded. This essentially removes the small imperfections and judder artifacts caused by nearest-neighbour interpolation, in exchange for adding some blur. This filter is good at temporal interpolation, and also known as "smoothmotion" (see tscale).

This filter is good at temporal interpolation, and also known as "smoothmotion" (see tscale).

default = 
directory = Render Options
help = Like scale, but apply these filters on downscaling instead. \nIf no option is selected, it will keep the same with the upscaler.
option = bilinear          Bilinear hardware texture filtering (fastest, very low quality).
option = spline36          Mid quality and speed. This is the default when using gpu-hq.
option = lanczos           Lanczos scaling. Provides mid quality and speed. Generally worse than spline36, but it results in a slightly sharper image which is good for some content types. The number of taps can be controlled with  scale-radius, but is best left unchanged. (This filter is an alias for sinc-windowed sinc)
option = ewa_lanczos       Elliptic weighted average Lanczos scaling. Also known as Jinc. Relatively slow, but very good quality. The radius can be controlled with scale-radius. Increasing the radius makes the filter sharper but adds more ringing. (This filter is an alias for jinc-windowed jinc)
option = ewa_lanczossharp  A slightly sharpened version of ewa_lanczos, preconfigured to use an ideal radius and parameter. If your hardware can run it, this is probably what you should use by default.
option = mitchell          Mitchell-Netravali. The B and C parameters can be set with scale-param1 and scale-param2. This filter is very good at downscaling (see dscale).
