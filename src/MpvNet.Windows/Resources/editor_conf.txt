option = yes
option = no

name = screenshot-high-bit-depth
file = mpv
directory = Video/Screenshot
help = If possible, write screenshots with a bit depth similar to the source video. This is interesting in particular for PNG, as this sometimes triggers writing 16 bit PNGs with huge file sizes. This will also include an unused alpha channel in the resulting files if 16 bit is used.
default = yes

name = screenshot-png-compression
file = mpv
directory = Video/Screenshot

name = screenshot-png-filter
file = mpv
directory = Video/Screenshot
help = <0-5> Set the filter applied prior to PNG compression. 0 is none, 1 is 'sub', 2 is 'up', 3 is 'average', 4 is 'Paeth', and 5 is 'mixed'. This affects the level of compression that can be achieved. For most images, 'mixed' achieves the best compression ratio, hence it is the default.

help = Set the startup volume. 0 means silence, 100 means no volume reduction or amplification. Negative values can be passed for compatibility, but are treated as 0. Since mpv 0.18.1, this always controls the internal mixer (aka "softvol"). Default: 100

help = Specify font to use for subtitles that do not themselves specify a particular font. The default is  sans-serif.

name = sub-font-size
file = mpv
directory = Subtitle
help = Specify the sub font size. The unit is the size in scaled pixels at a window height of 720. The actual pixel size is scaled with the window height: if the window height is larger or smaller than 720, the actual size of the text increases or decreases as well. Default: 55

directory = Window
width = 400
help = Set the window title. This is used for the video window, and if possible, also sets the audio stream title. Properties are expanded. Warning! There is a danger of this causing significant CPU usage, depending on the properties used.

help = <0-32> In multi-monitor configurations (i.e. a single desktop that spans across multiple displays), this option tells mpv which screen to display the video on.

name = taskbar-progress

help = Show progress in taskbar.
default = yes
option = yes

name = osd-playing-msg

directory = Window
help = Set the duration of the OSD messages in ms. Default: 1000

name = osd-scale-by-window
file = mpv
directory = Window
help = Whether to scale the OSD with the window size. If this is disabled, osd-font-size and other OSD options that use scaled pixels are always in actual pixels. The effect is that changing the window size won't change the OSD font size.

help = keepaspect-window will lock the window size to the video aspect. Default: yes
default = yes

name = keep-open
file = mpv
directory = Playback
default = no
option = yes     If the current file ends, go to the next file, keep the last file open.
option = no      If the current file ends, go to the next file. If idle is set to no, the player exits after the last file.
option = always  Playback will never automatically advance to the next file.

name = keep-open-pause
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = If set to no, instead of pausing when keep-open is active, just stop at end of file and continue playing forward when you seek backwards until end where it stops again.
default = yes

help = If set to no and keep-open is also set to no, the player exits after the last file ends.
default = yes
option = yes
option = no
option = once

name = loop-file
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = <N|inf|no> Loop a single file N times. inf means forever, no means normal playback.\n\nThe difference to loop-playlist is that this doesn't loop the playlist, just the file itself. If the playlist contains only a single file, the difference between the two option is that this option performs a seek on loop, instead of reloading the file. loop is an alias for this option.

name = save-position-on-quit
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = Always save the current playback position on quit. When this file is played again later, the player will seek to the old playback position on start. This does not happen if playback of a file is stopped in any other way than quitting. For example, going to the next file in the playlist will not save the position, and start playback at beginning the next time the file is played.\n\nThis behavior is disabled by default, but is always available when quitting the player with Shift+Q.
default = no
option = yes
option = no

name = watch-later-options
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = The options that are saved in "watch later" files if they have been changed since when mpv started. These values will be restored the next time the files are played. This is a string list option. For more information visit:
url = https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-watch-later-options

name = hr-seek
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = Select when to use precise seeks that are not limited to keyframes. Such seeks require decoding video from the previous keyframe up to the target position and so can take some time depending on decoding performance. For some video formats, precise seeks are disabled. This option selects the default choice to use for seeks; it is possible to explicitly override that default in the definition of key bindings and in input commands.
default = absolute
option = yes       Use precise seeks whenever possible.
option = no         Never use precise seeks.
option = absolute  Use precise seeks if the seek is to an absolute position in the file, such as a chapter seek, but not for relative seeks like the default behavior of arrow keys.
option = always    Same as yes (for compatibility).

name = track-auto-selection
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = Enable the default track auto-selection. Enabling this will make the player select streams according to aid, alang, and others. If it is disabled, no tracks are selected. In addition, the player will not exit if no tracks are selected, and wait instead (this wait mode is similar to pausing, but the pause option is not set).\n\nThis is useful with lavfi-complex: you can start playback in this mode, and then set select tracks at runtime by setting the filter graph. Note that if lavfi-complex is set before playback is started, the referenced tracks are always selected.
default = yes
option = yes
option = no

name = loop-playlist
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = <N|inf|force|no> Loops playback N times. A value of 1 plays it one time (default), 2 two times, etc. inf means forever. no is the same as 1 and disables looping. If several files are specified on command line, the entire playlist is looped. The force mode is like inf, but does not skip playlist entries which have been marked as failing. This means the player might waste CPU time trying to loop a file that doesn't exist. But it might be useful for playing webradios under very bad network conditions.

name = autocreate-playlist
file = mpv
directory = Playback
help = When opening a local file, act as if the parent directory is opened and create a playlist automatically.\n\nno: Load a single file (mpv default).\n\nFilter: Create a playlist from the parent directory with files matching --directory-filter-types. (mpv.net default)\n\nsame: Create a playlist from the parent directory with files matching the same category as the currently loaded file. One of the *-exts is selected based on the input file and only files with matching extensions are added to the playlist. If the input file itself is not matched to any extension list, the playlist is not autogenerated.
default = filter
option = no
option = filter
option = same 

name = auto-load-folder
file = mpvnet

help = For single files automatically load the entire directory into the playlist. (deprecated mpv.net option, autocreate-playlist can be used instead)
default = yes

option = no

name = reset-on-next-file
file = mpv
directory = Program Behavior
help = Normally, mpv will try to keep all settings when playing the next file on the playlist, even if they were changed by the user during playback. This can be changed with this option. It accepts a list of options, and mpv will reset the value of these options on playback start to the initial value.
